# GetCleanData_CourseProject
Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

Includes run_analysis.R, a script that takes the UCI human activity recognization data and processes it into a tidy dataset containing averages and standard deviations of the raw data aggregated by activity and subject.

In the study, sequences of raw data were recorded for 30 subjects performing each of 6 different activities.

In this analysis, only the data on the means and standard deviations of those sequences of raw data are used.

See the code book (CODEBOOK.md) for explanations of the variables included.
